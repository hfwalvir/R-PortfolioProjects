# R-PortfolioProjects

**PROJECT 1:**
## Social Network Analysis in R

This project demonstrates the power and versatility of social network analysis using R. It showcases various techniques for creating, visualizing, and analyzing network structures, leveraging the `igraph` package and other tools in R's ecosystem.

### Key Features:
1. **Network Creation**: Illustrates how to create network graphs from both manual edge lists and data frames.
2. **Visualization**: Demonstrates multiple ways to plot networks, including:
   - Basic plots with customized colors and sizes
   - Layouts like Fruchterman-Reingold and Kamada-Kawai
   - Visualizations that reflect network metrics (e.g., node degree)
     
3. **Network Metrics**: Calculates and utilizes various network measures such as:
   - Degree (in, out, and total)
   - Diameter
   - Edge density
   - Reciprocity
   - Closeness and betweenness centrality
    
4. **Advanced Analyses**: 
   - Hub and authority scores
   - Community detection using edge betweenness
     
5. **Data Import**: Shows how to import network data from CSV files for analysis.
   
7. **Statistical Visualization**: Includes histogram generation for node degree distribution.

This project serves as both a tutorial and a reference for conducting social network analysis in R. It's suitable for beginners looking to understand the basics of network analysis, as well as for more advanced users seeking code examples for specific network metrics or visualization techniques.The code demonstrates the entire workflow from data import to complex analysis and visualization, making it a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in exploring social networks using R.
